# ViewBindingExample

This project is used for **[ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)** library tutorials on **[U4Universe](https://www.youtube.com/u4universe)** Youtube channel.

# Introduction
View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.

**In most cases, view binding replaces findViewById.**
